      available is AutoFix at 10 AM. Shall I book it?"
User: [Voice] "Yes"
Bot: [Voice] "Done! Appointment confirmed for tomorrow at 10 AM"
```

**Example Interactions:**
```
User: "Car makes grinding noise when braking, pulls to left"
Bot: [Thinking indicator]
     "I'm analyzing this carefully... considering multiple factors"
     
     [After 15 seconds]
     "Based on deep analysis:
      
      Primary Issue (85% confidence):
      - Worn brake pads on left side
      - Possibly stuck caliper
      
      Secondary Concerns (45% confidence):
      - Wheel bearing issue
      - Brake rotor warping
      
      Reasoning:
      1. Grinding noise indicates metal-on-metal contact
      2. Pulling left suggests uneven brake force
      3. These symptoms together strongly point to brake system
      
      Recommendation:
      - Immediate inspection required (safety issue)
      - Estimated cost: $200-500
      - Time: 1-2 hours
      
      Should I find a nearby garage for you?"

     [Image returned with annotations]
     
     "I can see:
      ✓ Clean engine bay
      ⚠️ Oil cap appears loose (red circle)
      ⚠️ Belt shows minor cracking (yellow highlight)
      
      Immediate Action:

      - Belt replacement in next 3-6 months
      - Estimated cost: $80-150
